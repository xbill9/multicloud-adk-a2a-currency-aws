#   3. a cloud goes offline and the median holds
#   4. a cloud lies and is named as the outlier

# Acts 3 and 4 are the point. Any demo can show three green ticks; the claim
# this project actually makes is about what happens when one participant is
# wrong, and that is only worth anything if you watch it happen.

# LOCAL, direct-brain. This is a protocol and consensus demo, not a
# cross-cloud measurement -- nothing here crosses a cloud boundary and the
# latencies are loopback. See docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md for what deployment adds.

  - Nothing in THIS SCRIPT is deployed. All three agents here are local and
    no measurement above crosses a cloud boundary -- but all three are also
    deployed for real, and acts 1 and 2 have hosted equivalents:
      ./infra/deploy_master_aws.sh run      three clouds, one question
      ./infra/deploy_master_aws.sh matrix   the 3x3 against hosted servers
      ./infra/deploy_master_aws.sh verify   the negative controls
    Acts 3 and 4 stay local on purpose: killing and skewing a participant is
    something you can only do to an agent you own the process of.
  - Latencies are loopback and direct-brain (no model). They measure protocol
    and framework overhead, nothing else.
  - The three agents read the same fixture table, so agreement in act 1 is by
    construction. That is why act 4 exists.
