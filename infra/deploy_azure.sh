# **This is the leg that is not keyless, and that is the finding.** It used to
# be: a Federated Identity Credential trusting https://accounts.google.com, with
# the subject pinned to the Cloud-Run-hosted master's service account, and no
# secret anywhere. Moving the master to AgentCore removed the thing that made
# that possible. Entra's FIC wants a JWT assertion from an issuer it can
# discover, an AgentCore execution role is not one, and outside EKS/IRSA or
# Cognito AWS will not mint a token for an arbitrary audience. There is nothing
# to federate *with*, so this leg falls back to a client secret.
#
# The secret is written straight into AWS Secrets Manager and read by the master
# with the same role that signs its other two legs, so it is never a plaintext
# value in the runtime's configuration and never lands in a file here. That
# reduces the blast radius. It does not restore the claim: one long-lived
# credential exists, and every summary of this mesh has to say so.
#
# `secret` and `auth` are two halves of one story and neither is sufficient. The
# secret decides who can *obtain* a token for this app; `auth` decides whether
# the app *demands* one. Ship only the first and the leg reports an auth mode
# while answering anyone who asks -- a claim about the caller, dressed as a
# control. That was briefly true here, and it is why `auth` exists.
