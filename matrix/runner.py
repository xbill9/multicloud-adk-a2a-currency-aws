"""Fill the 3x3 A2A interop matrix: every client stack against every cloud's agent.

The question this answers is not "does A2A work" -- each vendor demonstrates
that against its own agent -- but "does vendor X's client actually talk to
vendor Y's server". Every cell is one real A2A call, so a cell can fail on
transport, on the agent card, on the task lifecycle, or on the reply format,
and the recorded FailureKind says which.
